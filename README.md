### __UDL-Cisco-Global.xml__ : Notepad++ UDL file

  Built to be used with configuration files coming from Cisco ASA, routers and catalyst switches.
  
  To be saved under `AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\userDefineLangs\` folder (might require Notepad++ restart)
  Then, open a saved Cisco configuration file, and in the "Language" menu, pick the "Cisco_Global" entry (should be at the bottom of the languages list).
  
  Works better with a dark theme (such as "Obsidian" theme)
